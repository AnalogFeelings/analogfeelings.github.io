                    Just go to <a href="/index.html"><u>the home website with a URL</u></a>. It's
                    as easy as that. Also don't try to randomly guess subpages, theres nothing hidden here. Trust me.

                A problem has been detected and GitHub Pages has redirected you here to prevent an ugly 404 website <br>
                that uses Times New Roman.

                ERROR_PAGE_NOT_FOUND
                <br><br>
                The problem seems to be caused by the fact that you cannot type a URL properly, or you got pranked.
                <br>
                The system will not try to collect data, after all, this is a just a dumb website replicating a<br>
                Windows XP bugcheck!
                <br><br>
                Please make sure your URL is correct and if you were sent this by a friend or something, <br> tell them to
                learn how to use Ctrl + C instead of typing the URL out manually.
                <br><br>
                If this problem persists, who knows, maybe I have revamped the entire webpage's structure!
                <br>
                Please go back to the <a href="/index.html"><u>main website</u></a> to properly navigate
                this site.

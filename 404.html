				A problem has been detected and GitHub Pages has redirected you here to prevent an ugly 404 website <br>
				that uses Times New Roman.
				<br><br>
				ERROR_PAGE_NOT_FOUND
				<br><br>
				The problem seems to be caused by the fact that you cannot type a URL properly, or you got pranked.
				<br>
				The system will not try to collect data, after all, this is a just a dumb website replicating a<br>
				Windows XP bugcheck!
				<br><br>
				Please make sure your URL is correct and if you were sent this by a friend or something, <br> tell them to
				learn how to use Ctrl + C instead of typing the URL out manually.
				<br><br>
				If this problem persists, who knows, maybe I have revamped the entire webpage's structure!
				<br>
				Please go back to the <a href="/index.html"><u>main website</u></a> to properly navigate
				this site.
				<br><br>
				Technical information:
				<br><br>
				*** STOP: 0x000000404 (0xDEADBEEF,0xBADDCAFE,0xDEADDEAD,0xBAAAAAAD)

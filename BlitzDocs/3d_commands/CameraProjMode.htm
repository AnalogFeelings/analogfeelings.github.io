                Sets the camera projection mode.

                <br />

                <br />
                The projection mode is the the technique used by Blitz to display 3D graphics on the screen. Using
                projection mode 0, nothing is displayed on the screen, and this is the fastest method of hiding a
                camera. Using camera projection mode 1, the graphics are displayed in their 'correct' form - and this is
                the default mode for a camera. Camera projection mode 2 is a special type of projection, used for
                displaying 3D graphics on screen, but in a 2D form - that is, no sense of perspective will be given to
                the graphics. Two identical objects at varying distances from the camera will both appear to be the same
                size. Orthographic projection is useful for 3D editors, where a sense of perspective is unimportant, and
                also certain games.

                <br />

                <br />
                Use 'CameraZoom' to control the scale of graphics rendered with orthographic projection. As a general
                rule, using orthographic projection with the default camera zoom setting of 1 will result in graphics
                that are too 'zoomed-in' - changing the camera zoom to 0.1 should fix this.

                <br />

                <br />
                One thing to note with using camera project mode 2, is that terrains will not be displayed correctly -
                this is because the level of detail algorithm used by terrains relies on perspective in order to work
                properly.

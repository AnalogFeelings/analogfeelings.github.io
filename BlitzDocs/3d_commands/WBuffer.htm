<h1>Description</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
Enables or disables w-buffering.<br />
<br />
W-buffering is a technique used to draw 3D object in order of their depth -  i.e. the ones furthest away from the camera first, then the ones closer to the  camera, and so on. <br />
<br />
Normally, z-buffering is used to perform such a technique, but a z-buffer can  be slightly inaccurate in 16-bit colour mode, for which the level of precision  is less than in 24-bit or 32-bit colour modes. This means that in some situations,  objects will appear to overlap each other when they shouldn't and so on.<br />
<br />
To compensate for this, you can use w-buffering. This is a slightly more accurate  technique than z-buffering, although it may be less compatible on some set-ups  than z-buffering.

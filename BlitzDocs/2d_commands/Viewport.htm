                There are MANY MANY times you want to draw graphics (aliens, ships, etc) ONLY on a certain area of the
                screen while leaving the other areas alone. This is often referred to as 'windowing' or 'portaling' or
                'clipping' an area. Usually, you will perform all your drawing operations first (background, controls,
                etc), then section off the restricted area of the screen with VIEWPORT to do drawing in that area. There
                are a million uses for this; overhead map radar screens, Ultima style display windows, onscreen
                scrollers, etc. This is a bit more complex than most graphic commands, so be sure you have a good handle
                on it before trying to use it. The biggest tip I can give you about this command is: REMEMBER TO CLEAR
                THE VIEWPORT WHEN YOU ARE DONE! Do this by setting the viewport to include the whole screen (i.e.
                Viewport 0,0,640,480 if your game was in 640x480). Look carefully at the example. Remember, the second
                set of numbers isn't the ENDING location of the port - rather the SIZE of the port starting at the first
                coordinates.

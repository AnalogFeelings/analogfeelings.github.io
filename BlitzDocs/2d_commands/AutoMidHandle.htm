    <h1>Description</h1>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>
                When an image is loaded with LoadImage, the image handle (the location within the image where the image
                is 'drawn from') is always defaulted to the top left corner (coordinates 0,0). This means if you draw an
                image that is 50x50 pixels at screen location 200,200, the image will begin to be drawn at 200,200 and
                extend to 250,250.

                <br />

                <br />
                The MidHandle command moves the image's handle to the middle of the image. See this command for more
                information about the image's handle.

                <br />

                <br />
                This command eliminates the need for the MidHandle command by making ALL subsequently loaded images
                default to having their image handles set to mid.

                <br />

                <br />
                Note about the term 'handle'. There are two types of 'handles' we discuss in these documents. One is the
                location within an image - as discussed in this command. The other is a 'file handle', a variable used
                to hold an image, sound, or font loaded with a command. See LoadImage for more information about file
                handles.

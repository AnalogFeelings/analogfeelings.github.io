                There are a hundred and one uses for this command, but probably most often used would be to display a
                title screen or some other 'one time viewing only' image to the front buffer (as in our example).

                <br />

                <br />
                You can also load to an image buffer or back buffer. The image is scaled to match the buffer size. This
                command returns 1 if the command was successful, 0 if there was an error.

                Alters the pitch of a sound previously loaded with the LoadSound command. By changing the pitch, you can
                often reuse sounds for different uses or to simulate a 'counting up/down' sound. To make the sound
                'higher pitched', increase the hertz. Conversely, decreasing the hertz will 'lower' the pitch. Note:
                this is in relation to the original hertz frequency of the sound.

                Once you've opened a disk file (or stream) for reading, use this command to read a whole line of text
                from a text file or stream. Each line of text is returned as a string variable. This function can be
                used to read plain text files.
                <br />

                <br />

                <br />
                Characters are read from the input file until an "end-of-line" mark is found. An "end-of-line" can be a
                single carriage return (0Dh) or a single linefeed (0Ah) or carriage return followed by a linefeed (0Dh,
                0Ah). Reading beyond the end of file does not result in an error, but each value read will be a zero
                length string.
                <br />

                <br />

                <br />
                ReadLine$ returns all chars except chr$(13)/chr$(10).
                <br />

                <br />

                <br />
                Streams can only be used in Blitz Basic v1.52 or greater.

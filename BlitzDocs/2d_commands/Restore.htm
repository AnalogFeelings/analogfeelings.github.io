                When using Data statements to store large blocks of constants for use with the Read command, it is
                necessary to denote the start of the Data with a .Label. The Restore command moves the 'pointer' to the
                first Data statement's value following the designated label. You MUST use the Restore label command
                prior to using the Read command. This method allows you to store groups of Data statements
                non-sequentially. Its different (if you are used to other BASIC languages) but you will find it most
                flexible. See the example and other commands related to Data command.

                When you want to do real sound panning effects, this is the command you'll use. This will allow you to
                pan the sound channels on a 'per channel' basis between the left and right speakers. This command makes
                it very easy to produce some really killer stereophonic effects!

                <br />

                <br />
                The pan value is between -1 and 1 with 0 being perfect center. -1 is full left, and 1 is full right. To
                make it somewhere in between, try -.5 for 50% left or .75 for 75% right.

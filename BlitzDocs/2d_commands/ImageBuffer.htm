                There are 1000 reasons for this command. Simply put, you may want to 'draw' on an existing image you've
                loaded (LoadImage or LoadAnimImage) or created (CreateImage). You could, for example, have a blank wall
                graphic and you want to add 'graffiti' to it based on the user action (Jet Grind Radio baybeee!
                Sorry...). Instead of trying to draw a dozen images all over the wall, just use the SetBuffer command to
                denote the wall graphic as the 'target' buffer, and draw away! Next time you display that graphic
                (DrawImage), you will see your changes! This is a powerful command!

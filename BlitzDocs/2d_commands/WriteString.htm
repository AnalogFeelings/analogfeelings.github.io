                Once you've opened a disk file (or stream) for writing, use this command to write a string variable to
                the file.

                <br />

                <br />
                Each string is stored in the file as a 4 byte (32bit) integer followed by the characters that form the
                string. The integer contains the number of characters in the string, i.e. its length. Note, that
                Carriage Return, Line Feed and Null characters are NOT use to indicate the end of the string. A file of
                strings cannot be read like a text file, since it contains string variables and not text. A null string,
                i.e. a string of zero length ("") is stored as 4 bytes, an integer count with a value = zero, followed
                by no Characters. Note strings are not limited to 255 characters as in some languages. Reading beyond
                the end of file does not result in an error, but each value read will be a zero length string.

                <br />

                <br />
                Streams can only be used in Blitz Basic v1.52 or greater.

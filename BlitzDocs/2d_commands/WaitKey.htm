                This command makes your program halt until a key is pressed on the keyboard. Used alone, it simply halts
                and waits for a key press. It can also be used to assign the pressed key's ASCII value to a variable.
                See example.

                <br />

                <br />
                In MOST CASES, you are not going to want to use this command because chances are likely you are going to
                want things on the screen still happening while awaiting the keypress. In that situation, you'll use a
                WHILE ... WEND awaiting a KeyHit value - refreshing your screen each loop.

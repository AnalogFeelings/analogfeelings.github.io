                Checks to see if the End of File of an opened file or stream has been reached. Use this to determine if
                you should continue to pull more information from a file/stream or not. Use this to read a text file of
                unknown length (say a README.TXT) and display it. See example.

                <br />

                <br />
                Eof returns 1 if eof has been reached or, in the case of a TCP stream, the stream has been 'nicely'
                closed.

                <br />

                <br />
                Eof returns -1 if something has gone wrong during stream processing.

                <br />

                <br />
                Streams can only be used in Blitz Basic v1.52 or greater.

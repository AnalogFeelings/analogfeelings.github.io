                First off, this ONLY works when you have joined a network game via StartNetGame or JoinNetGame and you
                have created a player via CreateNetPlayer (you must create a player, even if it is just to lurk). You
                must've received the message already, determined by the RecvNetMsg() command - and probably determined
                the type of message with (NetMsgType().

                <br />

                <br />
                The string value returned from this command is the actual message text that was sent.

                <br />

                <br />
                You will use NetMsgType(), NetMsgFrom(), and NetMsgTo() to get other important information from the
                message and act on it.

                <br />

                <br />
                The example requires that you run it on a remote machine while the local computer runs the example in
                the SendNetMsg command.

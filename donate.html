				<h1>
					Donate Anonymously
				</h1>
				<p>
					I've decided to set up an anonymous donation wallet, sadly through Bitcoin as that's the only currency
					supported by Proton Wallet. Ideally I would have used a less power-hungry currency, but I don't want to deal
					with the countless different exchanges and providers. If Proton ever adds support for Ethereum, which seemingly
					uses considerably way less power than Bitcoin, I will do the switch to that.
				</p>
				<p>
					I'm really sorry, but it seems like the only convenient way for me to receive fully anonymous donations without having to
					go through services like PayPal, Ko-fi or Patreon.
				</p>
				<p>
					Any donations are highly appreciated, I'm currently trying to sign up for high school for adults, which means it will be a long while
					before I can get a job with a decent income. Thank you so much in advance, even if you donated a very small amount, it makes my day.
				</p>

					If there's any problem with the address, don't hesitate to email me through the sidebar. I will answer and update the site within
					24 hours or so.

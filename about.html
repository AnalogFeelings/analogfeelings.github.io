					About Page
				</h1>
				<p>
					This website went through 3 redesigns, the first 2 designs used a library called XP.css. Now I use my own custom design.
					<br>
					It's pretty lightweight, and I tried to keep JavaScript usage to minimum.
					<br><br>
					<b>Well, let's get to the point.</b>
					<br>
					This website is a nicer hub for my <a href="https://github.com/AnalogFeelings">GitHub</a> profile.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						The "Home" page is, well, the home tab. The main "entrance", if you will.
					</li>
					<li>
						The "Posts" page will pretty much have random blog posts about random things that I decide to
						randomly write about at random intervals.
					</li>
					<li>
						The "Knowledge" page is a sort of container for knowledge about obscure things, which I
						barely come across.
					</li>
					<li>
						The "Projects" page will contain an organized tree view of my projects.
					</li>
					<li>
						And the "About" page is what you are reading now!
					</li>
				</ul>

				Anyways, this as I said before, this website was built using something called XP.css during its first 2 designs.
				<br>
				Now you may be asking, "but why did you remove it? It looked so unique!". Well, it wasn't very mobile-friendly.
				<br>
				Hell, it wasn't even small-screen friendly! It also suffered from issues such as barely readable fonts, half-pixel scaling weirdness, and other garbage.

				<br><br>

				So instead, I decided to make my own design <b>FROM SCRATCH</b>. Yes, I also wanted to keep it relatively retro.
				<br>
				And after many days of extreme hyperfixation, here it is! The website you're looking at right now.

				<br><br>

				Isn't it cool? It even has mobile support! I know it's not something to brag about nowadays, but it is for me.

				<h2>In Memory of Ekaterina "BerkeliumAsset"</h2>
				<p>
					You know, I'm not good at writing memorials or anything of that kind, but if someone deserves a memorial,
					it's our friend BerkeliumAsset.
					<br>
					On the 25th of November 2021, CaptainCrunch received a WhatsApp message from Berk's mother telling us about
					her suicide.
					<br>
					At first, I thought it was some sort of prank, but sadly, it wasn't. I spent some time afterward thinking about
					her, our conversations, and everything surrounding her.
					<br><br>
					I'm sorry I didn't know how to reply to your call for help, I didn't know that it even was one.
					<br>
					To this day, I still feel kind of guilty about it, maybe I could have stopped you, and I'm so sorry.
					You helped me so much through sad times, you even helped me discover my gender identity, and I'm truly grateful
					for that.
					<br><br>
					Wherever you are now, I'm hoping it's a happier place, I really hope it is.
					<br>
					As of writing this, I'm almost 1 year into HRT, and Crunch has been having some rough times, but we are managing
					to pull through, although it has been very hard for me.
					<br>
					I'm going to be completely honest, I don't remember most of my interactions with you, as my medication has made
					me lose a lot of my memories before 2024, but I know that I felt safe, comfortable, and even happy when talking to you.
					<br>
					I'm sorry, I am so sorry that I didn't help you. I hope you can forgive me, as I find it hard to forgive myself.
					<br><br>
					We will never forget you, Berk. I miss you so much.
					<br><br>
					May you rest in peace.

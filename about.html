					<h1>
						About Page
					</h1>
					<p>
						This website went through 3 redesigns, the first 2 designs used a library called XP.css. Now I use my own custom design.
						<br>
						It's pretty lightweight, and I tried to keep JavaScript usage to minimum.
						<br><br>
						<b>Well, let's get to the point.</b>
						<br>
						This website is a nicer hub for my <a href="https://github.com/AnalogFeelings">GitHub</a> profile.
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>
							The "Home" page is, well, the home tab. The main "entrance", if you will.
						</li>
						<li>
							The "Posts" page will pretty much have random blog posts about random things that I decide to
							randomly
							write about at random intervals.
						</li>
						<li>
							The "Projects" page will contain an organized tree view of my most notable projects (which aren't
							many).
						</li>
						<li>
							And the "About" page is what you are reading now!
						</li>
					</ul>

					Anyways, this as I said before, this website was built using something called XP.css during its first 2 designs.
					<br>
					Now you may be asking, "but why did you remove it? It looked so unique!". Well, it wasn't very mobile-friendly.
					<br>
					Hell, it wasn't even small-screen friendly! It also suffered from issues such as barely readable fonts, half-pixel scaling weirdness, and other garbage.

					<br><br>

					So instead, I decided to make my own design <b>FROM SCRATCH</b>. Yes, I also wanted to keep it retro.
					<br>
					And after many days of extreme hyperfixation, here it is! The website you're looking at right now.

					<br><br>

					Isn't it cool? It even has mobile support! I know it's not something to brag about nowadays, but it is for me.

					<br><br>

					Do you have any opinions on my website? Head over

						Mentions of suicide below.
					</fieldset>

					<h2 class="inlineCenteredText">In Memory of Ekaterina "BerkeliumAsset"</h2>
					<p>
						Suicide is something that can happen to the people closest to you. Unfortunately, it has happened to us
						with our dearest friend BerkeliumAsset.
						<br><br>
						Today, 25th of November 2021, CaptainCrunch has received a WhatsApp message from BerkeliumAsset's mother
						telling us about her suicide.
						<br><br>
						Berk was a sweet person, with dreams, loving friends, and a nice personality, but she has committed suicide.
						<br>
						We didn't help her because she seemed okay the night before, but it seems that she had personal problems she
						did not want to tell us about.
						<br>
						Berk was a great friend, and she helped me in sad times, especially when I discovered my gender identity.
						<br><br>
						May she rest in peace.

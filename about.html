					About Page
				</h1>
				<p>
					This website went through 3 redesigns, the first 2 designs used a library called XP.css. Now I use my own custom design.
					<br>
					It's pretty lightweight, and I tried to keep JavaScript usage to minimum.
					<br><br>
					<b>Well, let's get to the point.</b>
					<br>
					This website is a nicer hub for my <a href="https://github.com/AnalogFeelings">GitHub</a> profile.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						The "Home" page is, well, the home tab. The main "entrance", if you will.
					</li>
					<li>
						The "Posts" page will pretty much have random blog posts about random things that I decide to
						randomly write about at random intervals.
					</li>
					<li>
						The "Knowledge" page is a sort of container for knowledge about obscure things, which I
						barely come across.
					</li>
					<li>
						The "Projects" page will contain an organized tree view of my projects.
					</li>
					<li>
						And the "About" page is what you are reading now!
					</li>
				</ul>

				Anyways, this as I said before, this website was built using something called XP.css during its first 2 designs.
				<br>
				Now you may be asking, "but why did you remove it? It looked so unique!". Well, it wasn't very mobile-friendly.
				<br>
				Hell, it wasn't even small-screen friendly! It also suffered from issues such as barely readable fonts, half-pixel scaling weirdness, and other garbage.

				<br><br>

				So instead, I decided to make my own design <b>FROM SCRATCH</b>. Yes, I also wanted to keep it relatively retro.
				<br>
				And after many days of extreme hyperfixation, here it is! The website you're looking at right now.

				<br><br>

				Isn't it cool? It even has mobile support! I know it's not something to brag about nowadays, but it is for me.

				<br><br>

				Do you have any opinions on my website? Head over

				<h2>In Memory of Ekaterina "BerkeliumAsset"</h2>
				<p>
					Suicide is something that can happen to the people closest to you. Unfortunately, it has happened to us
					with our dearest friend BerkeliumAsset.
					<br><br>
					On the 25th of November 2021, CaptainCrunch had received a WhatsApp message from her mother
					telling us about her suicide.
					<br><br>
					Berk was a sweet person, with dreams, loving friends, aspirations, and a great personality, but she has committed suicide.
					<br>
					We didn't help her because she seemed okay the night before, but it seems that she had personal problems she
					did not want to tell us about.
					<br>
					Berk was a great friend, and she helped me tremendously in sad times, especially when I discovered my gender identity.
					<br><br>
					Wherever you are now, I hope you're happier than ever before.
					<br>
					I know you can't read this, but I miss you so much, Berk. I'm sorry I didn't realize what was happening when you messaged me.
					<br><br>
					May she rest in peace.

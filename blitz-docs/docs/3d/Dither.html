		<b>Warning!</b>
	</legend>
	Microsoft seems to have removed 16-bit modes in the latest versions of Windows.
	<br>
	This command will do nothing on 32-bit modes.
</fieldset>
<p>
	This command enables or disables hardware dithering.
	<br><br>
	Hardware dithering is useful when running games in 16-bit colour mode.
	Due to the fact that 16-bit mode offers fewer colours than the human eye can detect, separate bands of colour are often noticeable on shaded objects.
	However, hardware dithering will dither the entire screen to give the impression that more colours are being used than is actually the case.
	<br><br>
	Due to the fact that 24-bit and 32-bit offer more colours than the human eye can detect, hardware dithering is made pretty much redundant in those modes.

		<b>Remarks</b>
	</legend>
	Dithering is emulated in software in Windows 8 and higher, and only works in fullscreen.
	<br>
	Performance may be degraded. Use with caution.

		<b>Warning!</b>
	</legend>
	Microsoft seems to have removed 16-bit modes in the latest versions of Windows.
	<br>
	This command may do more bad than good on 32-bit modes.

<p>
	This command enables or disables w-buffering.
	<br><br>
	W-buffering is a technique used to draw 3D object in order of their depth - i.e. the ones furthest away from the camera first,
	then the ones closer to the camera, and so on.
	<br>
	Normally, Z-buffering is used to perform such a technique, but a Z-buffer can be slightly inaccurate in 16-bit colour mode, for which the level of precision is less
	than in 24-bit or 32-bit colour modes. This means that in some situations, objects will appear to overlap each other when they shouldn't and so on.
	<br><br>
	To compensate for this, you can use W-buffering. This is a slightly more accurate technique than Z-buffering, although it may be less compatible
	on some set-ups than Z-buffering, and may cause issues on 24-bit and 32-bit modes.

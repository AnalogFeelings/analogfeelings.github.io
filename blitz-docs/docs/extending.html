<p>
	Extending the engine is done through a "UserLib", which consists of two files:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		A <b>.dll</b> file containing the library's code.
	</li>
	<li>
		A <b>.decls</b> file that declares all the library's functions for BlitzBasic.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The <b>.decls</b> files are CRUCIAL. Without one, BlitzBasic won't be able to locate the functions you want to use from the DLL file.
	<br>
	Let's have a quick rundown of the <b>.decls</b> file format.
</p>

<h2>
	The ".decls" Format
</h2>
<p>
	Each <b>.decls</b> file should begin with a <b>.lib</b> directive, followed by a whitespace and the quoted name of the DLL file to be loaded.
	<br>
	Example:
</p>
<pre data-src="samples/extending/Header.decls"></pre>
<p>
	Afterwards, you must define a list of functions you want to expose to BlitzBasic. There are a few pitfalls:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		No default parameter values are allowed.
	</li>
	<li>
		If no function return type is specified, the function is a 'void' function - ie: it returns nothing.
	</li>
	<li>
		Instead of object parameters, you can only specify 'void*' parameters using a '*' type tag. Such parameters can be assigned ANY object or bank, so BE CAREFUL!
	</li>
	<li>
		The declaration must be followed by the C decorated name. This takes form of a <b>:</b> followed by the quoted decorated name.
		<br>
		Example:
	</li>
</ul>
<pre data-src="samples/extending/CDeclaration.decls"></pre>
<p>
	To get a list of exports from a DLL file, please read <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/dash-exports?view=msvc-170">this page</a>.
</p>

<h2>
	Important Rules
</h2>
<p>
	So, here is a list of very important rules:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Functions MUST use the _stdcall convention.
	</li>
	<li>
		Floats are passed and returned as per standard C/C++ conventions.
	</li>
	<li>
		Strings MUST be in C format (
		<code class="language-c">const char*</code>
		), no std::string allowed.
	</li>
	<li>
		Banks and objects can be passed into functions. The value passed is a pointer to the first byte of storage.
		<br>
		No information is passed about the type or size of the memory though, so <b>PROCEED WITH EXTREME CAUTION</b>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Banks and objects cannot be returned from functions, and arrays are not supported in any way.
	</li>
	<li>
		C++ name mangling is not allowed, you must use
		<code class="language-cpp">extern "C"</code>.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>
	Writing a DLL
</h2>
<p>
	Now, here is how we would write a DLL.
</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Open up Visual Studio and create a <b>"Dynamic-Link Library"</b> project.
	</li>
	<li>
		Delete all the files, and turn <b>"precompiled headers"</b> off in the project settings.
	</li>
	<li>
		Copy <b>runtime.lib</b> from the <b>userlibs</b> folder into the project's root directory, and link into it.
		<br>
		This will allow you to call the BlitzBasic <b>DebugLog</b> and <b>RuntimeError</b> functions.
	</li>
	<li>
		Write the library code.
	</li>
	<li>
		Compile the code.
	</li>
	<li>
		Create the corresponding <b>.decls</b> file.
	</li>
	<li>
		Place <b>MyLib.dll</b> and <b>MyLib.decls</b> in the userlibs folder of your Blitz3D TSS installation.
	</li>
	<li>
		You're done!
	</li>
</ol>

		<b>Remarks</b>
	</legend>
	When building a standalone executable for your game, you must place the userlib's DLL alongside the executable.

<h2>
	Sample Code
</h2>
<p>
	File: <b>MyLib.h</b>
</p>
<pre data-src="samples/extending/MyLib.h"></pre>
<p>
	File: <b>MyLib.cpp</b>
</p>
<pre data-src="samples/extending/MyLib.cpp"></pre>
<p>
	File: <b>MyLib.decls</b>
</p>
<pre data-src="samples/extending/MyLib.decls"></pre>

	Hopefully this guide will help you.

						Using modern toolchains for Windows 95!

						Edited on <b>2024-05-01 15:21</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						It's April 11th, 2024, and MattKC uploads a video about "backporting" .NET Framework 2.0 to Windows 95.
						<br>
						Well, sorta. It wasn't really a backport (since .NETFX is proprietary), but a "compatibility layer" backport.
						<br><br>
						Either way, it kind of inspired me to do something similar, but instead of with .NET, it would be with C/C++.
						Thus, <a href="https://github.com/AnalogFeelings/ChicagoCRT">ChicagoCRT</a> was born.
						<br>
						The "Chicago" in the name is there because Windows 95's codename during development was "Chicago", and "95CRT" wasn't a good name.
					</p>
					<h2>
						What is ChicagoCRT?
					</h2>
					<p>
						ChicagoCRT is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/malxau/minicrt">MiniCRT</a>, which is a small MSVCRT replacement that doesn't rely
						on modern windows APIs.
						<br>
						It had two major issues though:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							It referenced <b>memset</b> from the actual MSVCRT, which isn't available when you disable it.
						</li>
						<li>
							It didn't compile with <b>/arch:IA32</b> on. This caused problems on older systems.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						I decided to fork the project and fix these issues. Both were obviously kind of simple to fix.
						<br>
						But first, I decided to remove NMAKE and use a standard Visual Studio project for this, since NMAKE is old and hard to maintain.
					</p>
					<h2>
						Fixing memset
					</h2>
					<pre data-src="./resources/code/old_memset.c"></pre>
					<p>
						This is the original memset implementation used in MiniCRT. As you can see, it tries to prevent the compiler from being
						"smart" and optimizing the code to a memset call from the MSVCRT.
						<br><br>
						Sadly, modern compilers are too good at optimizing and can still see through what this code is trying to do, so I had to come up
						with a solution.
						<br>
						Aside from the solution, I also had to clean up the code since it was hard to guess from a first glance was it was doing.
					</p>
					<pre data-src="./resources/code/new_memset.c"></pre>
					<p>
						MSVC has a feature where you can disable optimization at a function level by using the <b>optimize</b> pragma directive.
						<br>
						And sure enough, doing this causes MSVC to stop optimizing the function to a call to <b>memset</b>. This may also cause it to not use vectorization or
						any other fancy optimizations, but since we are targeting systems that didn't even have MMX or SSE, it's fine.
						<br><br>
						I've also went ahead and replaced the confusing code with a pretty standard memset implementation, so now it's much more compact and easy to read.
					</p>
					<h2>
						Fixing the architecture
					</h2>
					<p>
						This was the simplest to fix, as I just had to add one line in the .vcxproj file.
					</p>
					<pre data-src="./resources/code/ia32.xml"></pre>
					<p>
						This could also be done in the Visual Studio GUI under <b>C/C++ > Code Generation</b> and the <b>Enable Enhanced Instruction Set</b> setting.
						<br>
						And now, I could finally test this on an actual Windows 95 setup. I don't have a real old computer, so I had to use 86box for it.
					</p>
					<h2>
						Beating MSVC into submission
					</h2>
					<p>
						As you can probably guess, modern MSVC does not output very Windows 95-friendly executables unless you really force it to.
						<br>
						For this, I've had to modify several project options on Visual Studio:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Change the file extensions to .c instead of .cpp to avoid hidden allocations and more.
						</li>
						<li>
							Switch the character set to ANSI, as Windows 95 didn't have support for Unicode at all.
						</li>
						<li>
							Disable the standard library, as it references APIs Windows 95 lacks (this is where ChicagoCRT comes in).
						</li>
						<li>
							Disable SDL checks, as this may cause issues.
						</li>
						<li>
							Disable C++ exceptions, this is probably not needed if you're using C.
						</li>
						<li>
							Disable RTC, as this references functions from the MSVCRT.
						</li>
						<li>
							Disable security checks, as those add extra runtime overhead and may cause issues as well.
						</li>
						<li>
							As with ChicagoCRT, disable enhanced instruction sets.
						</li>
						<li>
							Disable randomized base address.
						</li>
						<li>
							Remove the x64 target and set x86 as the default.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						As you can probably see, this is a very secure codebase (sarcasm), but it is now ready to be compiled and ran on Windows 95 corre-
						<br><br>

						<br><br>
						Well, seems like I jinxed it.
					</p>
					<h2>
						Going around MSVC's bullshit
					</h2>
					<p>
						I was stuck here for like half an hour, I was thinking that maybe I configured something wrong.
						<br>
						Eventually, I grabbed a hex editor and took a look at the PE header. I noticed the minimum OS and subsystem versions were set to
						6.0, which is Windows Vista.
						<br>
						Windows 95 uses OS version 1.0 and subsystem version 4.0, so I had to try to get MSVC to output these values.
						<br><br>
						MSVC does have a flag to set the minimum OS version, but it refuses to set anything lower than Windows Vista, so we will have to bruteforce it.
						<br>
						I came up with a C# script to run as a post-build event that patches the output executable with the correct values.
					</p>
					<pre data-src="./resources/code/patcher.cs"></pre>
					<h2>
						After success
					</h2>
					<p>
						With this script, we finally got the executable to run on Windows 95!
						<br>
						By this moment, ChicagoCRT was still called MiniCRT since it wasn't public yet, by the way.
						<br><br>

						<img src="./resources/success.png" alt="Message box showing a message from the program."/>

						<br><br>
						Although it's kind of boring, don't you think? It needs something more to be more impressive.
						<br>
						I decided to just port the Win32 sample project to the same system and add a bit of extra functionality. Thankfully, I didn't need to change anything
						regarding the compiler, it just worked fine!
						<br><br>

						<img src="./resources/fancy.png" alt="A fancier application showing dialogues, timers, and a menu bar as well as an app icon."/>

						<br><br>
						And since this is Windows, here it is running on my host Windows 11 system!
						<br><br>

						<img src="./resources/uglyfancy.png" alt="The same app, but on Windows 11."/>

						<br><br>
						It's ugly since it lacks visual styles and reverts to the default legacy styles, but it works fine!
						<br>
						If you're wondering about the specs of the emulated Windows 95 machine, here they are:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>CPU</b>: Intel Pentium 75MHz</li>
						<li><b>Motherboard</b>: ASUS P/I-P55T2P4</li>
						<li><b>Memory</b>: 8MB</li>
						<li><b>GPU (2D)</b>: S3 ViRGE/DX (375)</li>
						<li><b>GPU (3D)</b>: 3dfx Voodoo</li>
						<li><b>SPU</b>: SoundBlaster 16</li>
					</ul>

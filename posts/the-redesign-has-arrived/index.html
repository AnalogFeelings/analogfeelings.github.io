					<b>Well, here it is!</b><br><br>

					The redesign I have been working on for months is finally done! I hope I never get to do all that flexbox bullshit ever again.<br><br>

					You may have noticed that the website now uses a Windows 2000 theme by default instead of the old Windows 98 one, and no, you are not hallucinating.<br>
					I didn't like the Windows 98 color scheme for this specific website design, so I decided to slightly modify the colors of XP.css to fit 2000 more.<br>
					I think it looks quite nice! Maybe one day I will implement 7.css and XP.css together to make some weird abomination, who knows?<br><br>

					Oh, yeah! I kinda forgot, sorry for the lack of activity in the blog recently! I've been so busy with mental health and redesig related issues that I couldn't
					bring myself to write an interesting blog post.<br><br>

					I'm working on a Windows Forms app that will let me make new posts easier! It's called HideoutHelper, but the GitHub repository for it is still private, and I won't
					make it public until its finished.<br><br>

					<b>And yes, I know the scaling is fucked up when the browser is tiny.</b><br>

					So don't even bother asking.<br><br>

					Over all, this has been more of an announcement post than a blog post. But it's important sooooo I decided to add it here :)<br><br>

					Oh and by the way, happy pride month!

					Getting UWP unit tests to work was a pain.

				<p class="postInformation">
					Posted on <b>2023-05-01 19:41</b>
					<span class="postInformationBullet"></span>
					Never Edited
				</p>
				<p>
					So, lets begin with a short story on how I got here in the first place.
					<br><br>

					I recently became the owner of a Mastodon client called Tooter through a GitHub conversation. The poor guy spent 3 years
					without a reply!
					<br>
					I came around, and after a very long conversation (misinformation), I got ownership of the repository.
					<br><br>

					<img src="./resources/longconvo.png" alt="A screenshot of the GitHub conversation."/>

					<br><br>
					You can find the repository for it in my projects page! <b>But thats not the point of this post!</b>
				</p>
				<h2>
					The Actual Story
				</h2>
				<p>
					I lied. This post does have to do with my project.
					<br><br>

					On my big quest to clean up the 4-year-old outdated codebase (that didn't even compile), I wanted to implement GitHub Actions to automate
					unit tests to make contributing easier.
					<br>
					What I didn't know was that I was about to spend almost an entire day doing changes to the YAML file, back-and-forth with the Actions tab and
					the text editor.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Explaining The Workflow
				</h2>
				<p>
					Lets begin by the workflow triggers part. This is probably the simplest part to understand, but I will start with it anyways
					for the sake of completeness.
				</p>
				<pre data-src="./resources/code/full-attempt.yml" data-range="3,15"></pre>
				<p>
					We want the workflow to run on each push and pull request, only if they target the <b>master</b> branch and if the modified files
					are <b>cs</b> or <b>csproj</b> files.
					<br>
					Running actions if someone modifies a markdown file for example would be extremely wasteful of the limited time per month that we are
					allowed to use Actions for.
					<br><br>

					And last, the <b>workflow_dispatch</b> trigger allows us to run the workflow manually from GitHub's webpage.
				</p>
				<pre data-src="./resources/code/full-attempt.yml" data-range="16,23"></pre>
				<p>
					Here we use a job matrix to be able to run multiple configurations and target architectures with a single workflow job.
					<br>
					This will let us easily adapt the workflow in case we decide to test more architectures or configurations.
					<br><br>

					We also specify <b>windows-latest</b> as the runner, which at the time of writing, is Windows Server 2022.
				</p>
				<pre data-src="./resources/code/full-attempt.yml" data-range="25,27"></pre>
				<p>
					Here we have some simple environment variables to make the workflow a bit cleaner and easier to modify.
					<br>
					The matrix variables change on every configuration and target, so we can use them to easily access the output executable.
				</p>
				<pre data-src="./resources/code/full-attempt.yml" data-range="29,48"></pre>
				<p>
					Here we use the checkout action to download or update the repository, and then we set up MSBuild with another action.
					<br><br>

					We then run MSBuild with the <b>-t:restore</b> flag, which downloads or updates any NuGet packages required by the project.
					<br>
					Afterwards, we swap it out with the <b>-t:build</b> flag to actually produce an executable and APPX bundle.
					<br><br>

					Finally, we use the <b>vswhere</b> tool to find the Visual Studio install location to be able to use <b>VSTest</b>.
					<br>
					Then we execute the tests.
				</p>
				<h2>
					The Pitfalls
				</h2>
				<p>
					Of course, just like with everything related to UWP, there are some pitfalls.
					<br><br>

					The first one was that I tried to use <b>dotnet test</b> to do this.
				</p>
				<pre data-src="./resources/code/first-attempt.yml" data-range="37,39"></pre>
				<p>
					This obviously didn't work, since it expected a .NET 7.0 solution which UWP obviously doesn't support.
					<br>
					I then learnt that I needed to use MSTest for .NET Framework projects, but MSTest was deprecated, so instead I had to use VSTest.
					<br><br>

					But then I realized VSTest doesn't automatically build the project, unlike .NET 7.0's test suite, so I obviously had to add some MSBuild
					commands beforehand.
					<br><br>

					I then tried to add MSBuild, but I then quickly realized that you need to specify the unit test project alone since building the
					entire solution is wasteful.
					<br>
					Oh right, I almost forgot something! NuGet restoration. MSBuild doesn't do it automatically. So don't forget that part.
					<br><br>

					About APPX bundles, you have to remove <code class="language-xml">&lt;PackageCertificateKeyFile&gt;</code> and
					<code class="language-xml">&lt;PackageCertificateThumbprint&gt;</code>, as well as setting
					<code class="language-xml">&lt;AppxPackageSigningEnabled&gt;</code> to <b>False</b> in the unit test project
					for the build to work fine.
					<br><br>

					Lastly, about VSTest, you cannot use the default .NET Framework target. You must use <b>frameworkUAP10</b>, otherwise it will refuse to launch.
					<br>
					Then, I also found out that you must not give it the output <b>.exe</b> file, but instead the <b>.appxrecipe</b> file. This is because UWP
					apps are containerized, so running the raw <b>.exe</b> file doesn't work.
				</p>
				<h2>
					Conclusion
				</h2>
				<p>
					This GitHub Actions adventure was not fun at all, but in the end it was very worth it. I hope this helps people in the future.
					<br>
					Thanks to <b>ahmed605</b> and <b>Sergio0694</b> for some of the help I needed.
					<br><br>

					Here's the full workflow file if you need it, you obviously will need to adapt the environment variables though:

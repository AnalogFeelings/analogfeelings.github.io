					Verifying my website on Discord
				</h1>
				<p class="postInformation">
					Posted on <b>2023-09-11 17:43</b>
					<span class="postInformationBullet"></span>
					Never Edited
				</p>
				<p>
					Recently, Discord added a new feature for some users that allows them to connect their website to their
					account.
					<br>
					This allows you to show off your website next to your other social media accounts, which is pretty neat.
				</p>
				<p>
					I was one of the lucky ones who got the feature early, because if you didn't know, Discord rolls features
					out gradually instead of immediately.
					<br>
					So off I went trying to verify my website!
				</p>
				<h2>
					The Required Steps
				</h2>
				<p>
					First, Discord will ask you to enter the domain name of your website into a text field, and click <b>Next</b>.
				</p>
				<fieldset class="specialFieldset importantFieldset">
					<legend>
						<img src=""/>
						<b>Important</b>
					</legend>
					The domain name must not contain the <b>https://</b> prefix or anything else.
					<br>
					For example, <b>google.com</b> is valid, but <b>https://google.com/</b> is not.
				</fieldset>
				<p>
					Then, it will show you two verification options, <b>DNS record</b> or <b>HTTP</b>.
					<br>
					I chose HTTP because I do not own a real domain.
				</p>
				<p>
					The HTTP method asks you to create a folder called <b>.well-known</b> in the root of the website. You must then
					add a file called <b>discord</b> (without file extension), and paste in the string the client shows you.
					<br>
					This way, you should be able to verify your domain correctly, <b>in theory</b>.
				</p>
				<h2>
					The Bullshit Begins
				</h2>
				<p>
					So, it turns out that if you don't have a real website with a server and a domain, Discord will not be able to find
					the verification file.
					<br>
					The reason for this is because of <b>Jekyll</b>, the static site generator that GitHub Pages uses by default.
				</p>
				<p>
					Jekyll ignores directories which begin by a period, which means the built site will not contain said directories.
					<br>
					This seems to be related to the UNIX philosophy of marking such directories as "hidden".
				</p>
				<p>
					Luckily, this behavior can be modified to fit our needs.
				</p>
				<h2>
					The Solution
				</h2>
				<p>
					Thanks to the user <b>TomasHubelbauer</b> on GitHub, I've discovered the solution for the problem.
					<br>
					You need to create a file called <b>_config.yml</b> in the root of your website, with the following contents:
				</p>
				<pre data-src="./resources/solution.yml"></pre>
				<p>
					Save it, and commit it to your repository. Wait for it to build, and then try to verify your site again.
					<br>
					Enjoy your bragging rights!
